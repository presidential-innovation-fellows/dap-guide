      <h1>Introducing the Digital Acquisition Accelerator</h1>
      <p>The federal government spends a lot of money on information technology purchases, but doesn’t always receive the full value’s worth of that money. Fortunately, there are a number of proven practices such as human-centered design and agile software development that can help close the gap. But how can agencies adapt their acquisition policies, processes, and team structures to take advantage of these new and promising ways of working?

<br>Introducing the Digital Acquisition Accelerator.</br>

<br>Announced in March by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), the Digital Acquisition Accelerator is a pilot program aimed at helping agencies accelerate the adoption of digital acquisition practices. It’s funded by the General Services Administration, and is managed and delivered by 18F and the Presidential Innovation Fellows. Its purpose is to complement, not replace, the creation of an Acquisition Innovation Lab, per the OFPP memo.

        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>We provide agencies with the skills, knowledge, and tools they need to succeed with digital acquisitions. We do this by helping agencies establish their own internal group of experts by working together on two real-world acquisitions that deliver valuable, high-quality products that users love.

<br>Expertise is created over a series of training sessions, facilitated workshops, and access to expert coaches through five main phases:
</br><ol> 
<li><b>Ignition.</b> Basic training on human-centered design, lean-agile methodologies, open innovation, and modular contracting.</li>
<li> <b>Inception. </b> Developing an effective product and project vision through techniques such as proto-personas, problem deconstruction, and user-story mapping.</li>
<li> <b>Procurement.</b> Planning and executing a procurement plan in alignment with the product and project vision. </li>
<li> <b>Delivery.</b> Applying modern practices when working with vendor(s) to produce a valuable, adaptable, and reliable product.</li>
<li> <b>Landing.</b> Capturing the results, lessons learned, and stories that can be reused by other government agencies. </li>
</ol>
Key to our approach is a “learn by doing” model, which is why we ask agencies to nominate two acquisitions to go through the Accelerator. For the first acquisition, we provide structured guidance to help scope and procure the required services. For the second acquisition, teams execute it on their own using their new-found knowledge from the first acquisition. We’ll still be around to provide ongoing coaching throughout, of course, because it’s important to us that agencies not only learn, but succeed.

What we teach you draws on the latest experience and guidance from leading practitioners at organizations such as 18F, the U.S. Digital Service, and the Health and Human Services Buyer’s Club.

<h1> What you'll learn </h1>
<p> We’ve designed the Accelerator program to help agencies institutionalize key principles and practices in the following areas:

        <h3>Human-centered design</h3>
        <p>A creative approach to problem solving that starts with the people whom you’re designing for and evolves into a solution that is crafted to suit their needs.

        <h3>​Lean-agile methodologies </h3>
        <p>An empirical approach to creating products that relies on short, frequent feedback loops, enabling you to make more timely and informed decisions about what features truly satisfy the needs of the business and users.</p>

      <h1>How your Agency can participate</h1>
      <p> This Accelerator program is currently running as a pilot, which means we’re still learning how best to design it. Toward this end, we’ve broken it into two phases—alpha and beta. 

During the alpha phase, which we expect to complete toward the end of 2016, we’re working with two agencies — the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These agencies will work on the following products: 
</p>
<h2>Treasury</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) Registry modernization, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) </li>
<li>IRS Auction site (auction.gov) modernization, Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
</li></ul>
<h2>Federal Bureau of Investigation</h2>
<ul> <li>National Virtual Translation Center (NVTC) redesign </li>
<li>Mobile tagging and scanning of crime scenes </li> </ul>

<p>The graphic below shows the current stage for each of the four acquisitions in the alpha phase:
</p>
<br>
As we move into the beta phase in the beginning of 2017, we’re planning to invite another 3-4 agencies to participate. If you’d like your agency to be part of the beta phase, your agency must complete a brief application process. Once the application period is closed, a committee consisting of members from 18F, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, U.S. Digital Service, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy will formally review, qualify, rank, and select applicants for participation. Here are some of the things that we’re looking for in an agency:
<ul><li>Top-level leadership support among procurement and technology executives for establishing an internal cadre of digital acquisition experts
</li> <li>Two upcoming acquisitions that are budgeted, involve custom software solutions, and are of low complexity (for example, minimal external system dependencies), and mid- to high-impact</li>
<li>Ability to dedicate necessary time and resources </li>
<li>Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act-level agency or a major component of one. All CFO-Act agencies must have identified an Acquisition Innovation Advocate as part of a Acquisition Innovation Lab that was required to be stood up as part of the March 9 memo </li>
<li>Acceptance of a Memorandum of Understanding between with the General Services Administration, which outlines roles and responsibilities between the two teams</li></ul>

If selected, a dedicated team of digital acquisition experts from 18F and the Presidential Innovation Fellows will be assigned at no cost to your agency for a period of six to eight months.

To stay engaged, please follow our [blog] and [listserv] for the latest updates, which is where we will announce when the next phase of the pilot program opens up to additional agencies. Also, if you’re interested in learning more, send us an email at dap-18f@gsa.gov.
